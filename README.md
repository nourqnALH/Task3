#  Robotic Arm Joint – 3D Printing Setup & Material Recommendation

##  STL File
This project includes a 3D printable **robot arm joint** that was converted into STL format and prepared for FDM printing using **AnkerMake Studio**.

##  Slicer: AnkerMake Studio

We used AnkerMake Studio to slice the STL file and prepare it for printing on the **AnkerMake M5** printer with a **0.4 mm nozzle**.

## Material Recommendation: **PETG**

###  Why PETG?
PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol) was chosen over standard PLA+ because:

- **High impact resistance** — ideal for joints and moving parts.
- **Better flexibility** — less brittle than PLA+.
- **Heat resistance up to ~80°C** — suitable for mechanical parts that might face friction or motor heat.
- **Low warping** — prints well on open printers like the AnkerMake M5.
- **Strong inter-layer adhesion** — critical for load-bearing parts like robotic joints.
